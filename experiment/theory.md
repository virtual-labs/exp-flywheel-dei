This experiment is an introduction to some basic components of rotational dynamics. By performing the experiment, you will develop an understanding of Moment of Inertia
If a body is free to rotate about a fixed axis, then a torque is required to initiate or change the rotational motion of the body. The torque τ ⃗  of a force about an axis is given by the cross-product of the force F ⃗ and the distance from the axis of rotation r ⃗

Mass moment of inertia also known as rotational inertia is a measure of a body’s resistance to a change in its rotation direction or angular momentum. Just as the mass is a measure of resistance of linear acceleration, moment of inertia is a measure of resistance to angular acceleration.
A flywheel is a heavy thick circular disc designed for storing rotational energy. It is generally made of cast iron or steel along with a long axle that rotates on ball bearings. It is usually mounted on the shaft of machines such as turbines, steam engines, diesel engines etc and makes an engine move smoothly by storing kinetic energy and keeping the engine at a constant speed throughout its cycle. When the machines are on higher loads, it acquires Kinetic Energy and maintains that constant angular velocity during idle conditions. The capacity of storing / shedding of kinetic energy depend on the rotational inertia of the flywheel.
